# How to run the project
With Docker Compos in this project solution, you can easily run the project. This docker was created with Visual Studio tools and parts of it have been modified as needed. For this reason, it is highly recommended that this file be run by Visual Studio , otherwise you will probably receive an error.
After running the file, please be a little patient because it is a bit time consuming. According to the tests I did, if you have a "node" image on your docker, you will probably run into problems. So delete it if possible.
If you follow the above, the project will be easily loaded on your system and you can view the services and use the project by going to http://localhost:200.
